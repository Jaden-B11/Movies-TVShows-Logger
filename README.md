# Movies-TVShows-Logger
The logger for movies & TV shows is a personal media tracking website for logged-in users to keep track of the TV shows and movies they watch. It provides an all-in-one stop for users to organize what they are keeping up with. The user would be able to set a status to any show or movie with it being set as currently watching, completed, on-hold, dropped, or planned to watch.
